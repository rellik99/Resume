# Resume

I am thrilled to present my first project, a website showcasing my resume. As a budding web developer, I've delved into the world of HTML to craft this platform, which serves as a digital representation of my skills, experiences, and aspirations. Through this website, I aim to provide a comprehensive overview of my professional journey, educational background, and achievements.
